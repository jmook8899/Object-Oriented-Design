InMemoryDB - C++
In This project I developed a Non SQL database using unordered map and c++ template classes, this database has api's for CRUD operations.
The data stored in the database can be persisted to and from an xml file.

Code Publisher - C++
Code analysis consists of extracting lexical content from source code files, analyzing the code's syntax from its lexical content, and building a Type Table (TT) or an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) that hold the results of our analysis. It is then fairly easy to build several backends that can do further analyses on the data held in TT or AST to construct code metrics, search for particular constructs, or some other interesting features of the code.
This project takes in source code files of c++ and c# project.
